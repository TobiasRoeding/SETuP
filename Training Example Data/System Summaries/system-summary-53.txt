Tuesday, after Bob Woodward confirmed that Mark Felt was Deep Throat, William Gaines, the professor involved, said he and his students accepted that. Robert Novak disclosed Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA operative-based on a government leak that has sparked a federal investigation. Some journalists did divine that Felt was Deep Throat, including James Mann, a former Los Angeles Times correspondent. The Post's executive editor during Watergate, Ben Bradlee, said it's a good thing for the country that Felt's identity has finally been revealed.
