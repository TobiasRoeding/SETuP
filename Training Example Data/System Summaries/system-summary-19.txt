Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the identity of "Deep Throat" until his death. Felt wanted to become FBI director. As the bureau's second- and third-ranking official during a period when the FBI was battling for its independence against the administration of President Nixon, Felt had the means and the motive to help uncover the web of internal spies, secret surveillance, dirty tricks and coverups that led to Nixon's unprecedented resignation on Aug. 9, 1974 and prison sentences for some Nixon's aides. After initially refusing to confirm Felt as the source, Woodward and Bernstein eventually gave in.
