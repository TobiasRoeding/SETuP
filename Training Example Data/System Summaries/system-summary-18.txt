Woodward, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor when the Watergate story broke in 1972, said they kept the identity of "Deep Throat" secret at Felt's request, saying his name would be revealed upon his death. When the Vanity Fair scoop broke, Woodward and Bernstein's initial reaction was to reiterate what they had said for years: that they would only reveal Deep Throat's identity when the source died. Bob Woodward's book on "Deep Throat" will be rushed onto bookshelves by next month, his publisher said, two days after a monthly magazine revealed the famed Watergate source's real identity.
