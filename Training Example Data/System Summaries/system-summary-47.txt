Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the identity of "Deep Throat" until his death. Woodward, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor when the Watergate story broke in 1972, said they kept the identity of "Deep Throat" secret at Felt's request, saying his name would be revealed upon his death. A lot of us have always wondered who Deep Throat might have been. When the Vanity Fair scoop broke, Woodward and Bernstein's initial reaction was to reiterate what they had said for years: that they would only reveal Deep Throat's identity when the source died.
