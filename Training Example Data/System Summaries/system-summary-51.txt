Former FBI deputy director Mark Felt was hailed as a hero and denounced as a villain Wednesday after confessing to being the Watergate scandal's "Deep Throat" -- a disclosure that startled even President George Bush. Aides to the late president Richard Nixon said Wednesday that former FBI deputy director Mark Felt, unmasked as the anonymous Watergate source known as "Deep Throat," had breached professional ethics by leaking leaking information. Bob Woodward's book on "Deep Throat" will be rushed onto bookshelves by next month, his publisher said Thursday, two days after a monthly magazine revealed the famed Watergate source's real identity.
