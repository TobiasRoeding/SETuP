Tuesday, after Bob Woodward confirmed that Mark Felt was Deep Throat, William Gaines, the professor involved, said he and his students accepted that. Robert Novak disclosed Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA operative-based on a government leak that has sparked a federal investigation. Some journalists did divine that Felt was Deep Throat, including James Mann, a former Los Angeles Times correspondent. Even though Deep Throat's identity had been one of Washington's most enduring and fascinating mysteries, Novak declared that just about everyone in the Capital had known all along.
