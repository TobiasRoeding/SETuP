Woodward, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor when the Watergate story broke in 1972, said they kept the identity of "Deep Throat" secret at Felt's request, saying his name would be revealed upon his death. A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, was the "Deep Throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former president Richard Nixon, his family said Tuesday. "Mark Felt was Deep Throat and helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," the statement said. W. Mark Felt wanted to become FBI director.
