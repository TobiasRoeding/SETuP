W. Mark Felt wanted to become FBI director. In a column posted Wednesday, Novak wrote that he was not alone in suspecting Deep Throat's identity. The Post's executive editor during Watergate, Ben Bradlee, said Tuesday it's a good thing for the country that Felt's identity has finally been revealed. Woodward had been preparing his Deep Throat book for some time, with a view to publishing after Felt, now 91, died. However, the unexpected revelation of Felt's secret in Vanity Fair magazine on Tuesday, meant the project was moved onto the fast track.
