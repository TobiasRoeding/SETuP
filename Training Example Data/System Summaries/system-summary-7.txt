A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, was the"Deep Throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former president Richard Nixon, his family said Tuesday. The celebrity magazine's naming this week of former FBI assistant director Mark Felt as the famed Watergate source,"Deep Throat," was sensational on two levels. "Mark Felt was Deep Throat and helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," the statement said. Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the identity of"Deep Throat" until his death.
