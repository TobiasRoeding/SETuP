The revelation of the identity of deep throat:    A magazine named Felt as the likely Deep Throat in 1974, prompting a denial from Felt and a threat to sue that he never followed up on. Woodward, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee, the Post's executive editor when the Watergate story broke in 1972, said they kept the identity of "Deep Throat" secret at Felt's request, saying his name would be revealed upon his death. Ensuing reactions:    "My grandfather is pleased that he is being honored for his role as Deep Throat with his friend Bob Woodward,".
