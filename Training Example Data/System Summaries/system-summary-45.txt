A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, was the "Deep Throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former president Richard Nixon. Bob Woodward's book on "Deep Throat" will be rushed onto bookshelves by next month, his publisher said Thursday, two days after a monthly magazine revealed the famed Watergate source's real identity. One day after the disclosure that former FBI Deputy Director W. Mark Felt was Deep Throat, Washington was awash with claims from political celebrities and minor Watergate figures that they'd known the identity of the secret source all along.
