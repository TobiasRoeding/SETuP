A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, was the "Deep throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former president Richard Nixon, his family said Tuesday. Felt's grandson, Nick Jones, made the claim in a statement read to reporters outside the family home in Santa Rosa, California, following an article in Vanity Fair in which Felt told the magazine he was "Deep Throat."
