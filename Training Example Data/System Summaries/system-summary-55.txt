A retired FBI official, Mark Felt, was the" Deep Throat" source who leaked secrets to two Washington Post reporters about the Watergate scandal that brought down former president Richard Nixon, his family said Tuesday. Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the identity of" Deep Throat" until his death. When the Vanity Fair scoop broke, Woodward and Bernstein's initial reaction was to reiterate what they had said for years: that they would only reveal Deep Throat's identity when the source died. "Mark Felt was Deep Throat and helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," the statement said.
