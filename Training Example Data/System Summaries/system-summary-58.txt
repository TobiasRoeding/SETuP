Woodward and Bernstein have said they will not reveal the identity of "Deep Throat" until his death. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein confirmed Tuesday that former FBI number-two W. Mark Felt was the "Deep Throat" source who helped unravel the Watergate scandal and bring down President Richard Nixon. Former Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan, in an appearance on MSNBC television, bluntly said Felt was a "traitor." "Mark Felt was Deep Throat and helped us immeasurably in our Watergate coverage," the statement said. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover died shortly before the Watergate break-in.
